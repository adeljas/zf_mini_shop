	Mini Shop Website 
-----------------------------------

This is a simple implementation of a mini-shop website built using Zend Framework v1.12



Features:

1- Listing of products on the homepage showing the name, price and a picture of the product.
2- Detailed page of the product showing the name, price, descrtiption and picture(s) of the product.
3- Shopping cart with Add to cart, remove a specific item from cart, and empty cart functions.

* The website uses filesystem caching for the most requested queries, that is needed to retrieve the items with their pictures.



Deployment steps:

- Download and install Zend Framework 1.12 and assign its path to include_path in php.ini
- Import the database dump file "minishop.sql" to your MySQL database, note that the dump includes CREATE DATABASE and USE queries, if you want
to use another name, change it in the SQL dump file before importing, and also change it in application/configs/application.ini
- Start Apache and point your browser to PROJECT_DIR/public/index.php
